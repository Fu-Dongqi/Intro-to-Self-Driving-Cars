## <a name="project-0"></a>Project_0_Joy Ride
Jump into writing code that controls a simulated vehicle. Send throttle and steering commands to the
car to try and get it to navigate around a test track.

## <a name ="project-1"></a>Project_1_2D_Histogram_Filter_in _Python
In this first project, you will write the `sense` and `move` functions for a 2-dimensional histogram filter in
Python

## <a name ="project2"></a>Project_2_Implement_a_Matrix_Class
In this project you’ll practice using your object oriented programming and matrix math skills by filling out
the methods in a partially-completed `Matrix` class.

## <a name ="project3"></a>Project_3_Translate_Python_to_C++
In this project you’ll apply your knowledge of C++ syntax by translating the Histogram Filter code from
the first course into C++.

## <a name ="project4"></a>Project_4_Optimize_Histogram_Filter
A self-driving car can’t afford to waste any cycles or memory unnecessarily. In this project you’ll take
some functioning (but inefficient) C++ code and optimize it.

## <a name ="project5"></a>Project_5_Planning_an_Optimal_Path
You turn on your self-driving car, buckle up, and enter a destination. Navigating from A → B is not an
easy problem. In this project you’ll use your knowledge of data structures (in particular, graph data
structures) and search algorithms to write an algorithm which uses a map and traffic information to find
the quickest route between two points.
